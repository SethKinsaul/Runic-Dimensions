Create the Fireball Object:

1. In Unity, create a 3D Sphere or 2D Sprite to represent the fireball.

- Add a Rigidbody component to the fireball object for physics behavior.

- Add a Collider (e.g., Sphere Collider for 3D or Circle Collider for 2D) to detect collisions.

- Optionally, add a Particle System for fire effects and an Audio Source for sound effects.

2. Make It a Prefab:

- Drag the fireball object into your Project window to create a prefab.

- Delete the original fireball object from the scene.

3. Create the Fire Point
-Create an empty GameObject as a child of your character (e.g., name it "FirePoint").

-Position the FirePoint where you want the fireball to spawn (e.g., in front of the character's hand).

4. Write the Fireball Script
- Create a script called FireballSpell and attach it to your character.

5. Assign Components in Unity
- Attach the FireballSpell script to your character.

In the Inspector:

- Drag and drop your fireball prefab into the FireballPrefab field.

- Drag and drop your FirePoint GameObject into the FirePoint field.

- Set FireballSpeed to control how fast it travels.

- Change CastKey if you want a different button (e.g., KeyCode.Mouse1 for right-click).

6. Test Your Fireball
- Press Play in Unity.

- Press your assigned button (default is "F") to cast a fireball.

- Observe that the fireball spawns at the FirePoint and moves forward.
